Lisa discovers that the snacks are loaded with everything from hydrogenated petroleum oil to partially-deweaponized plutonium, but her protests are no match for the machine's slogans. Bart goes overboard with the snacks; three weeks later, either Uter's hair has turned yellow and spiky, or Bart is incredibly fat.

Marge is afraid that Bart is turning into a Catholic (which, with all of the sitting, standing, and kneeling, she calls "Simon Says without a winner"), but Homer is sidetracked by the fact that the school is having a pancake dinner followed by bingo, and when he discovers that he can be absolved of all sins through confession if he converts, Marge problems are doubled, especially when she realizes that Catholics do not believe in birth control.
